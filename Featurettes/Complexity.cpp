// Time Complexity --> The rate at which time increases with respect to the input size.
// Shows Big Oh Notation --> O() --> [Upper Bond]
    // For Worst Case Scenarios
    // Avoid Constants
    // Avoid Lower Values

// Theta --> Average Complexity
// Omega --> Best Case --> [Lowest Bond]


// Space Complexity --> Auxiliary Space + Input Space (Space that we take to solve the problem  +  Space that we take to store the problem)
//  c = a + b  --> Here, c = Auxiliary Space and a & b are Input Space

// Important for Memory Space
// Also Shows Big Oh Notation --> O()

// Never do anything to Input unless said so like this,    b = a + b
    // It can save us some space but it is a bad practice to manipulate the data
