# Cpp
My C++ notes which is good enough from my perspective. It is long but worth it :
  it is organised and well written 
  if still can't understand then use google or chatgpt

Just see .txt or .cpp files not every machine can run my .exe file if you don't know why just search it

And we have to focus on practice more.
